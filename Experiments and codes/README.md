These are all the codes for XINYI's internship.  
`DRAMAinPT`: The reproduction of the model DRAMA in PYTORCH. See DRAMA in https://city-perception.wixsite.com/anonymous.  
`MFA`: Our proposed model. This model involves Multi-task learning, Feature extraction and Attention mechanism. I introduce the architecture of model in the section "approach" of my report.  
`Mask2Former`: The panoptic segmentation model for feature extraction.  
`scripts`: Some scripts used for preprocessing pp2 dataset.  

The inputs(PP2 images, PP2 csv, segmentation info vector, segmentation area ratio vector)and singularities(dramainpt_v3,mask2former_self.sif) are saved in `/data/OG2102040` on LIGER.
